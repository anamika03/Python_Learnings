# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data types
# tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update the data inside tuple

example = ('sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday')
# no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
# tuples are faster than lists
# methods -- count, index, length func, slicing

print(example[1:5])
